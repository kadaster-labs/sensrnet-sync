# Sync Component - Bridge

This is the bridge between the [SensRNet Registry Backend](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-backend) using the [Eventstore.com](https://eventstore.com/). The bridge reads published events from the eventstore and adds them unto the ledger. It also listens for new events added to the ledger to add them to the eventstore in case these are relevant for this [Registry Node](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-home/blob/master/docs/Architecture.md#component-registry).

Is is based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/):

  <p align="center">A progressive <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="blank">Node.js</a> framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications, heavily inspired by <a href="https://angular.io" target="blank">Angular</a>.</p>
